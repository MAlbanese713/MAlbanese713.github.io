<h1>Welcome to Matthew's Programming Portfolio!</h1>
<p>
    This website is my beginning programming portfolio. <br>
    Inside of this website, I will be compiling all of the work that I am going to be doing within the CSC106 class. <br>
    This website will also serve as a way for me to keep track of my accomplishments, and what I have learned in the course.
