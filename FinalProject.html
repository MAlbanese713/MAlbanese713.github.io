Welcome to my final CSC 106 programming project page. Here, I am embedding a project that I have worked on for a while with my partner, John Luzzi. <br>
The program is an asteroid dodge game. The game has an information screen to explain how to play.<br>
You press the left and right arrow keys to move diagonally up and to the left, and diagonally down and to the right.<br>
You are the rocketship character, and the object of the game is to dodge as many asteroids as possible. <br>
Your score will go up as time goes on, however if you get hit by an asteroid you will lose 5 points. The highest possible score is 48 points. <br>
Try to earn a high score! When all 100 asteroids have passed, the game will end. </p>
