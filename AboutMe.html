<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi there! My name is Matthew Albanese. I am currently a senior at URI, on the CSC BA track. <br>
The University of Rhode Island has had a great impact on my life as a person all around. <br>
Ever since coming to college, I've grown in multiple areas of my life. <br></p>
<br>

<p>
I have 4 siblings, all of which are older than me. They have each graduated college, so I'm last in line. <br>
I have earned a black belt rank in Ronin Kempo Karate, back in Lincoln, RI. <br>
I like to play the Clarinet, I like to run, and play video games. <br>
I am a Christian, and the student president of Rhody Christian Fellowship (RCF) on the URI campus. <br>
I am an avid sports fan as well; I have played Volleyball all throughout highschool, and baseball when I was younger.<br>
            </p>
